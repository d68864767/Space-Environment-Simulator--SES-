# Simulation and Testing

This document outlines the simulation and testing procedures for the Space Environment Simulator (SES). The SES is designed to simulate various space environmental conditions on Earth for testing space-bound electronic components or for educational demonstrations.

## Electrical Functionality Testing

The electrical functionality of the SES can be tested using KiCAD. The schematic design and PCB layout files (`schematic_design.sch` and `pcb_design.kicad_pcb`) can be used to simulate the electrical behavior of the system. This includes testing the temperature control circuit, radiation simulation circuit, sensor integration, and the microcontroller unit (MCU).

## Environmental Testing

While KiCAD doesnâ€™t directly support environmental simulations, we can perform external testing of environmental aspects like temperature range and vacuum conditions. 

### Temperature Control Testing

The temperature control system can be tested by applying a range of temperatures and verifying the response of the system. The custom temperature sensor (`Custom_Temperature_Sensor` in `custom_components.lib`) should accurately measure the temperature within the system.

### Radiation Simulation Testing

The radiation simulation system can be tested by measuring the output of the LED arrays or radiation sources. The custom radiation source (`Custom_Radiation_Source` in `custom_components.lib`) should accurately simulate the solar radiation.

### Vacuum Chamber Testing

The vacuum chamber can be tested by creating a vacuum and verifying the pressure within the chamber. The pressure sensor in the system should accurately measure the pressure within the vacuum chamber.

## MCU Code Testing

The MCU code (`mcu_code.c`) can be tested by simulating the MCU behavior. This includes testing the control and monitoring of the temperature control system, radiation simulation system, and the vacuum chamber.

## Safety and Reliability Testing

The safety and reliability of the simulator under extreme conditions should be tested. This includes testing the system under extreme temperature conditions, high radiation levels, and vacuum conditions.

## Integration Testing

The integration of the electronic controls with the physical components like the vacuum chamber and thermal elements should be tested. This includes testing the control and monitoring of the system under various environmental conditions.

## Final Steps

After the simulation and testing phase, any issues identified should be addressed and corrected. Once the system has been validated, the SES can be used for testing and validating space-bound electronics or as an educational tool to demonstrate space conditions.
